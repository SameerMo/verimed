What has been submitted is the source code of the web app

There is no executable -> the app is hosted at the following address:

If needed to host locally from the verimed folder run npm install then npm run dev to start the frontend
then cd into backend and run node server.js 
the app should open the url localhost:5173
all api routes need to have http://localhost:5000 at the beginning or whichever port you are using

A google account is required but I would suggest 2 to test out the patient and doctor functionality
the extension metamask is also required and loaded with test eth which can easily be obtained from the google sepolia faucet
the wallet can hold 2 accounts or you can use 2 different browsers
